## Gate B decision: Approved with revisions

**Date:** 2026-05-06

## Required revisions before Analyst session

1. **Hypothesis:** Add a clear, single-sentence directional hypothesis to rq.md (e.g. "H1: Countries with lower v2x_libdem scores will exhibit a lower mean normalized citation ratio for SSH articles, after controlling for country fixed effects, year fixed effects, log GDP per capita, and log population.").

2. **Controls:** Explicitly specify in rq.md and analysis_plan.md: controls are `log(e_gdppc)` and `log(e_wb_pop)`.

3. **Robustness tests:** Add two pre-specified robustness checks to analysis_plan.md:
   - **RC1 — Exclude recent articles:** Re-estimate dropping articles published after 2018 (or within 5 years of the data end). Recent articles have had less time to accumulate citations, introducing right-censoring that may correlate with country-year patterns. This tests whether results are robust to citation maturity concerns.
   - **RC2 — Alternative regime measure:** Replace `v2x_libdem` with `lied_binary` as the main independent variable.

## No redesign required — proceed to Analyst session after revisions
